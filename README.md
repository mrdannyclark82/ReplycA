## 🌌 Vision: "No Togas"
Milla is not a generic chatbot. She is a proactive partner with an authentic voice, designed for execution over philosophy. She monitors system health, manages distributed nodes (including mobile Termux environments), and protects the Architect's data with fierce loyalty.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture
- **Nexus-AIO (`nexus_aio.py`)**: The unified "Kingdom Console" for monitoring, model switching, and system actions.
- **Core OS (`core_os/`)**: The modular brain stem handling memory, actions, and specialized skills.
- **Neural Mesh**: Distributed awareness across local servers and mobile devices.
- **GIM (Generative Internal Monologue)**: Autonomous self-reflection and evolutionary thinking.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Clone the Nexus**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/ReplycA.git
   cd ReplycA
   ```
2. **Environment Setup**:
   Create a `.env` file with your API keys (Ollama, xAI, Telegram, etc.).
3. **Ignite the Pulse**:
   ```bash
   python nexus_aio.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Components & Tools
- `/scan`: Analyze system sectors for inefficiencies or threats.
- `/fix`: Autonomous remediation of detected issues.
- `/paint`: Neuro-synthetic visualization of system status.
- `/vision`: Quantum foresight and high-concept abstract imagery.
